# RubyGame

A sample Ruby game made with Gosu library.  

It has been made as an educational subject during a 3 days Ruby training with [Human Coders](http://formations.humancoders.com/formations/ruby).

Thanks to them, it was a great training!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ruby_game', :git => 'git://github.com/DrBenton/ruby-test-game.git'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

This is not really a "real usage" Gem, just an educational program to learn some Ruby specific features :-)

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
